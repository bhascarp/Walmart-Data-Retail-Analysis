# Walmart Data-Retail Analysis
Overview:

One of the leading retail stores in the US, Walmart, would like to predict the sales and demand accurately. The business needs to understand the sales in their 45 stores and the impact of holidays and other factors. So, the objective of this project is to do the data analysis and provide insights to the stakeholders.

The data was available for years 2010, 2011 and 2012.

The analysis answered below key questions:

1. Which store is performing well and has a good growth rate? How significant are they from one another?
2. How are sales at different time periods?
3. Are the holidays affecting the sales in the stores? If so, how significant compared to non-holiday days?
4. Did the factors: temperature on day of sale, fuel price in the region, prevailing consumer price index and prevailing unemployment rate have an impact on the sales?
